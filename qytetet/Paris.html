	<p>Hemingway famously called Paris “a moveable feast” for its tendency to stick with you long after you've left. But he may have also been hinting at, how, no matter where you go while in the city, there's always something to see, hear, taste, or feel. He, like so many authors from around the world, found inspiration in the city's cafes, alleyways, and bars. Meanwhile, with some 150 museums, Paris doubles as an art history class, offering the very best of the discipline across centuries and styles. Facing so much choice, travelers will be forgiven for skipping the Louvre in favor of quieter moments at Musée Rodin or L'Orangerie.

    Paris continues to set the pace for innovation, as well, all while lending technological progress an aesthete's eye for perfection. Recent endeavors have included greening its urban landscape and experimenting with everything from stylish water taxis to VR time-travel telescopes.</p>
