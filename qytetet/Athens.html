	<h1>Athens</h1>
	<h2>P&euml;rshkrimet p&euml;r qytetin nga ana e lexuesve!</h2>
	<p>When it comes to arts capitals, Athens is often overshadowed by its European neighbors. But the ancient city is undoubtedly having a moment. This summer saw the arrival of documenta, the spectacle of modern and contemporary art occurring every five years that, for the first time, took place somewhere else other than Kassel, Germany. (The two cities shared hosting duties.) During the July and August heat, paintings, sculptures, and performances could be found everywhere, from the Acropolis to private homes and tavernas.

    While it remains to be seen whether the visual extravaganza will leave a permanent mark on the city’s art scene, other cultural stalwarts have been cropping up, too: The Renzo Piano-designed, $623 million Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, home to the National Opera and the National Library of Greece, opened last year, while the revamped National Museum of Contemporary Art is finally open to the public after a 12-year hiatus. To really get a feel for the city’s creative scene, Athens is best explored by foot without any specific agenda in mind: With street art to rival Berlin, neighborhoods like Metaxourgeio and Kerameikos offer enough gallery-hopping to fill an afternoon—and then some.</p>
