	<h1>Istanbul</h1>
	<h2>P&euml;rshkrimet p&euml;r qytetin nga ana e lexuesve!</h2>
	<p>It's the boundary between two continents; the entry-point into Europe for the Silk Road that extended all the way to the Korean peninsula; a place where you can sip an espresso in a third-wave coffee shop, steps from a Roman aqueduct, while the call to prayer emanates from a mosque that was built in the time of the Ottomans. There are the classics, of course, like the syncretic Hagia Sophia—once a church, then a mosque, and now a museum—and the famous Whirling Dervishes whose entrancing, twirling dance is an act of devotion to their Sufi faith.

    But under all that history and millennia-old tradition is a thriving, and subversive, hip-hop, contemporary art, and film scene, spurred by creators who use their expression as a way to comment on the turbulent times the country currently finds itself in. To find up-and-coming and established creatives alike, start with a Saturday evening in Karaköy, where Istanbul's old-meets-new aesthetic is in full bloom. Or head to the 15th Istanbul Biennale, taking place from September 16 through November 12, where everything from modern dance to street art will be on display.</p>
