	<p>At its peak, the Roman Empire extended over nearly two million square miles of land across Europe, Asia Minor, and North Africa. Today, that history—and the far-flung influences that made their mark on this ancient capital—are on display everywhere. (Vespas zip by the Roman Forum, which dates back to the seventh century BC, like its no big deal.) The recently restored Colosseum is such a part of the modern city's fabric that after a few days you start taking its grandeur for granted.

    The city's main attractions are famous not because of tourist hype, but because they really are that impressive—the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Capitoline Museums...the list goes on and on. No wonder it's known as the Eternal City: You could spend forever here and find new artistic and cultural treasures every day.</p>
