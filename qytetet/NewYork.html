	<p>Take it from us: It can be exhausting living in New York City. It's not only the subway stress, the crowds, and the delightful smells. It's also because there's just so much to do and it can be hard to summon the willpower to say no and have a night in. But then again, why would you want to?

    Free party at the Brooklyn Museum with a sneak-peek of an exhibition highlighting black female artists, followed by a live performance by a multicultural brass band? We'll be there. Beer tasting and lectures on brewing and botany amid the greenery of the Botanical Gardens in the Bronx? Yep. A career-spanning film retrospective of Frank Lloyd Wright at MoMA? As good as done. We'll sleep when we're dead.</p>
