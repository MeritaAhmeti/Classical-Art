	<h1>Venice</h1>
	<h2>P&euml;rshkrimet p&euml;r qytetin nga ana e lexuesve!</h2>
	<p>Nowhere else on earth is quite like Venice—a town built on water, accessible only by foot or boat, and a trading hub that linked the disparate cultures of the Old World. Western Europe is famous for its cathedrals, but there's none that match the magnificence of St. Mark’s Basilica, an architectural marvel owing to its blend of Byzantine and Italian architectural styles.

    But its not all about the past: The Venice Biennale, which runs this year until November 18, and late summer's Venice Film Festival, the oldest film festival in the world (its first edition was in 1932), continue to cement the city as a gathering place for artistic innovators. And there's no more colorful time to visit than during the masked extravaganza of the Venice Carnevale in February. Just remember, as the locals continue to emphasize, to be respectful while joining the tourist crowds.</p>
