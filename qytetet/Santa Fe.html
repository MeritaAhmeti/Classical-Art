	<h1>Santa Fe</h1>
	<h2>P&euml;rshkrimet p&euml;r qytetin nga ana e lexuesve!</h2>
	<p>You can't see all the art that Santa Fe has on offer on a single trip, so unless you're one for total sensory overstimulation, we don't suggest you try. On a first visit, it can seem there are more art galleries than restaurants in the cityâ€”they line the central plaza and its side streets, while the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum is downtown's centerpiece.

    The city has a unique ability to look outward, while also staying true to its traditions: The Museum of International Folk Art is packed with 130,000 objects, a tribute to craftspeople from around the world, while the annual SWAIA Indian Market, which runs every August, is the showcase for the region's Native American artists and artisans.</p>
